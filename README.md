__Changes the way items are enchanted to give players more control and reduce impact of RNG__

__Required both on client and server. Depends on [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)__

## Features
* XP costs are completely eliminated, instead you will have to use wide array of items provided by vanilla game
* Enchanting system now is discovery based. You need to obtain enchanted books first and right click them to learn new enchantments
* Once enchantment learned you can enchant items and books with it
* Enchantments applied to items can be leveled up at enchanting table at any time
* You can apply as many enchantments to item as configuration allows at any time. That means you don't need to fully enchant your item in one go
* Item enchanting and enchantments combining through anvil has been disabled
* Enchantment recipes are data driven and can be customized through data-packs at any time

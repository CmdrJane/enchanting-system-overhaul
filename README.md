# Enchanting System Overhaul(ESO)

__Changes the way items are enchanted to give players more control and reduce impact of RNG__

__Required both on client and server. Fabric version depends on [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)__

__Forge version does NOT require any additional dependencies__

__Project [wiki](https://github.com/CmdrJane/enchanting-system-overhaul/wiki) is here. Dedicated Discord channel is [here](https://discord.gg/rqcHgcCHq3)__

__You can support me on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cmdrjane) now__
